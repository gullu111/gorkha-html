          <p>11 Gorkha Rifles is an infantry regiment of the Indian Army  comprising Gurkha soldiers of Nepalese origin that was re-raised after independence. The regiment consists of primarily the Rais, Limbus and Sunuwar of eastern Nepal – mainly from Taplejung, Panchthar, Sankhuwasabha and Dhankuta districts. It also recruits from Indian Gorkhas and Bhutias from Darjeeling district, West Bengal and Sikkim. Though it is considered to be the youngest of the Gorkha regiments its lineage is as long as those of the 7th Gurkha Rifles and 10th Gurkha Rifles.

</p>
          <p>The regiment has participated in all major military operations India has undertaken since independence including in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, Operation Polo in 1948, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, and the Kargil War in 1999. Units of the regiment have also deployed abroad on UN missions. </p>
          <h1>Indo-Pakistani War of 1971</h1>
          <p>During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the 5th battalion was involved in the action to liberate East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), fetching the unit battle honour Bogra and theater honour East Pakistan. In the operations in East Pakistan, the unit had secured the Bogra town as part of 20 Mountain Division. In a daring operation, Lt. Teja Bedi single-handedly captured the headquarters along with the commanding officer and regimental medical officer of the Pakistan Army's 52nd battalion, Baloch Regiment, the regimental flag of which is still displayed upside down in the officers' mess of the unit as a prized possession.</p>
<h1> Kargil War </h1>
<p> During the Kargil War in 1999, the 1st battalion saw extensive action. Commanded by Col. Lalit Rai, it was tasked with the capture of several strategic peaks in the Kargil region. One of its units was led by Capt. Manoj Pandey, who posthumously received the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India's highest gallantry award, for his actions in Batalik sector. </p>
